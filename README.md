# Inception Guide

*(!) Work in progress (!)*
This is an ongoing work of translation of the guide by codesshaman at https://github.com/codesshaman/inception/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file. 

This guide is divided into several steps ordered as they should be learnt (or studied, you could say) and done.
